To use this:

1. apply whatever layout patch you want
2. in the Home Menu Optional Settings (which only show up when you're making a HomeMenu.nxtheme) click the '...' to add this .json as a custom common layout
3. export!



There really needs to be better documentation on these things... or at least easier to find if it is out there.
